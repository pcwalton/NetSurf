TTF2f Changelog
===============

0.04 (05-Mar-2011)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Output the first 256 glyphs in Acorn Latin1 order so converted fonts
are useful in applications that don't ask for a specific font encoding.

Fix handling of fonts that map multiple codepoints to a single glyph.

Ensure that any MessagesNN files are updated with details of converted fonts.

Many bug fixes and general improvements.

0.03 (15-Aug-2005)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
No longer create language fonts, as the font manager appears capable
of handling encoding files with /uniXXXX for symbol fonts. Quite why
this behaviour didn't appear to work when originally tested, I've no
idea. This change avoids any necessity to move Encodings files around.

0.02 (10-Sep-2004)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Remove buggy metrics code which caused fonts with <= 256 different 
horiAdvance values to have broken glyph spacings. All fonts now use 
the extended table format where the glyph number is the table index.
(Thanks to Paul Sprangers for reporting this)

Fix for fonts which don't embed glyph names (or use incorrect ones).
The glyph names are now retrieved from the Glyphs file. The format 
of the Glyphs file is as per the Adobe Glyph List comment. TTF2f
uses only columns 1 and 2.

Improve multitasking when extracting glyph metrics.

0.01 (07-Sep-2004)
